    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Through the online summer course at The Coding School, I was able to gain some background knowledge on Quantum Computing. Through this course, the main topics I gained insight on that define quantum computing were superposition, entanglement, quantum gates, and the Double Slit Experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Superposition</strong></p>
<p>Bits are used in classical computing and can have a value of either 0 or 1, like an off and on switch. You can’t balance the switch to be in the middle because it always moves up or down to on or off; likewise, bits can only have one value at once. However, qubits can have a value of 1 and 0 at the same time. It’s like the light switch being held in the middle and the lights flickering on and off. This is called superposition, which is having a value of 0 and 1 (off and on) at the same time.</p>
<figure><img src="https://tanishkamehta.github.io/researchWebsite/images/progress1bitvsqubit.png"/>
</figure>

<p>However, quantum mechanics was not something that everyone agreed on. Three scientists, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, also known as EPR, thought there were hidden variables to determine the state of the qubit after it was measured and collapsed. In other words, they thought that if something could not be predicted, then it did not describe reality and was an incomplete theory. Bohr, on the other hand, thought that nothing is defined if is not measured; he thought that qubit collapse was purely random. He said that it&rsquo;s not that we don’t know the value of the qubit, its that its not defined yet because there is no hidden variable to determine what it will collapse to.</p>
<p>The concept of superposition was explained by the Schrödinger Cat Paradox. In this paradox, there is a cat inside a closed box. There is a hammer on top of a vial of poison, but there is no way to tell whether the hammer dropped and broke the vial of poison, which would kill the cat. Therefore, it must be assumed that the cat is both alive and dead at the same time. Only opening the box, or measuring the state of the cat, would help us determine whether the cat is alive or dead; this is similar to qubits because when measured, they go from superposition (2 states) to a bit (1 state).</p>

<p>Einstein used this paradox to show that the cat staying alive or dead can’t be random; it&rsquo;s too confusing to just say that it’s completely random for the poison vial to break. However, this was eventually proved to demonstrate quantum mechanics because in fact, it is purely random; there are no hidden variables.</p>
<p>John Bell created an experiment to continuously measure the collapse of various qubits. However, this didn’t prove if the qubits’ values were already predetermined with hidden variables. Therefore, he changed how the qubits were measured each time. He ran statistical analyses on this and determined that the correlation between the outcomes of measurement as the changes in measurement were strong. Bell proved that quantum mechanics predicted stronger statistical correlations in the outcomes of these measurements than any hidden variable theory possibly could. Since there are no hidden variables to determine the collapse of the quantum state, this helps keep the information purely random. This has large applications in the cybersecurity world because it can keep information confidential.</p>

<p><strong>Entanglement</strong></p>
<p>Another advantage of quantum computing is the ability for qubits to become entangled. When two qubits are entangled, each of them are in superposition and dependent on the value of the other. For example, the qubits will have a superposition of 0 and 1. When one qubit is measured, it will collapse. The other qubit will automatically collapse to have the opposite state of the first qubit. This is useful because it cuts down on the time and computing power to process information transfer between qubits. For instance, say you have a pair of gloves, if you know one is left-handed, the other has to be right-handed. You saved time and energy because you didn’t have to test the other glove to check if it fits on your left hand; you already know it goes on the right.</p>

<p>The EPR group thought that during entanglement, there were two distinct objects that could be measured at different times, especially when they are light years away. However, when qubits are entangled, they are essentially two parts of one object. Einstein did not believe this because of his theory of relativity, which states that nothing is faster than light. Only massless particles could reach that speed and all particles with a mass could only approach, but never reach, it. This was known as the EPR paradox. In fact, Einstein called this phenomenon “spooky action at a distance”</p>

<p>Each particle has its own wave function. when two particles are entangled, their wave function becomes the same, meaning it has the same properties, since it is basically one object. Altering one object changes the wave function, which changes the other object as well, causing it to collapse. In the image, you can see two separate wave functions combine to form one function. Since it is a wave, no matter how far apart they are, they will always be entangled. This is called nonlocality since they do not depend on their location.</p>
<p><strong>Quantum Gates</strong></p>
<p>There are many quantum gates that can be applied to transform a qubit. The most common gates are below. Using the X, Y, and Z gates, any other gate can be created.</p>
<p><em>X-Gate:</em> This gate flips the value of the bit. For instance, if the input is X |0&gt;, the output would be |1&gt;.</p>
<p><em>Y-Gate:</em> This gate fips the value of the bit and changes its phase. For instance, if the input is Y |0&gt;, the output would be <em>i</em>|1&gt;.</p>
<p><em>Z-Gate:</em> This gate changes the phase of the input. For instance, if the input is Z |1&gt;, the output would be -|1&gt;.</p>
<p><em>Hadamard Gate:</em> This gate creates a superposition in the qubit. For instance, if the input is H |0&gt;, the output would be |+&gt;, which is a superposition of the states |0&gt; and |1&gt;.</p>
<p><em>Controlled Not (CNOT):</em> This gate is used to create entanglement and is applied on two qubits. It only changes the input when the input has the first qubit in the state |1&gt;; when it is in the state |1&gt;, it flips the value of the second qubit. A truth table for the CNOT gate is shown below.</p>

<p><strong>The Double Slit Experiment</strong></p>
<p>In the double slit experiment, electrons are shot through a surface with two slits. Since electrons have spin, they can behave like qubits; spin up and spin down can correspond to the state |0&gt; and state |1&gt;. Due to the wave-like nature of light, the electrons passing through teh two slits interfere, producting bright and dark bands on the screen, as shown in the image below on the left. However, since the light is always found to be absorbed on the second screen at discrete points, as shown on the right of the image, it demonstrates properties of individual particles. Thus, this experiment proved that qubits can behave as particles and as waves.</p>
